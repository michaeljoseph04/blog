I hope this site will clearly introduce readers to some of the work I've been doing in urban data analysis. Check out my [first post, a tutorial on using R as a GIS for urban data analysis work](http://michaeljoseph04.github.io/blog/2019-04-03-R-GIS-introduction.markdown). Also make sure to check out my [github repos](https://github.com/michaeljoseph04/) for code.
